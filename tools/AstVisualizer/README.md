# CSharpAstVisualizer: A tool to show the ASTs for C#.
This tool allows you to see the ASTs that are generated by the C# compiler. This information is typically needed when you want to write a rule that targets a particular construct. The process then becomes: Write the example in C#, see what the ASTs look like in the XML pane, and write the rule to match it.
